# node-express-mysql-demo
A REST API utilising Node.js and Express.

Interacts with a MySQL database and offers a range of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints.

## Developer Guide
1) Clone repository and open in an editor such as Visual Studio Code.
2) Run `npm install` in terminal.
3) Run a local MySQL server. Add a database named `api`, and a table named `bosses`.
4) Run `npm start` in terminal.
5) Use `curl` commands in a (separate) terminal to interact with the API, or navigate to `http://localhost:3001/bosses` in Chrome to view database data.
6) Edit the code and experiment to your heart's content :)
